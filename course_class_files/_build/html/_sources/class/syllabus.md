# Course Policies

Please read the information below as a reference for how this class will be conducted. 

# Grading Policy:

- Assessment Method    \quad      \quad \quad                Total Contribution to Final Grade:
  - 2 Homework each 10%,            \quad \quad \quad            20%,
  - 1 midterm exam                                 \quad \quad \quad       40%,

- **Midterm date**: April 29, 2021 during the lecture hour via Ninova. 
- Quizzes will be held during the lecture hours and the dates will be announced at well in advance. No make-up for quizzes.
- **Student studies, namely, quizzes and exam papers which are not written well, does not follow a proper mathematical writing language, and are hard to review, will get "0" credit for that question.**
- Please see an example for **a good homework** on Ninova.
- Please read the general advice given at:

  http://ma117.math.metu.edu.tr/course-info/general-advice/.

# Late Submission Policy
 There are **NO** make-ups for missed quizzes. 

# Final Exam Attendance Policy
 At least 30 points from in-semester studies (e.g., (Midterm * 0.4 + Quiz 1 * 0.1 + Quiz 2 * 0.1) greater than or equal to 30)

# Make-Up Exam Policy
 The students who miss either midterm exam or final exam due to a health problem
can take a make-up exam as long as they have a valid medical report taken on the exam day. The medical report
should be handed in immediately (within two days of its expiration). 

# Class Attendance Policy
 
The students are encouraged to attend classes, 
whereas the attendance is not mandatory in Spring 2021 semester due to Covid-19 pandemic. 
For that reason, the student is deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.

# Participation Policy

The students are expected to ask and answer
questions, participate in in-class activities, and
show their interest and engagement in the class. 


# E-mail Policy

Please:

1. Use a proper descriptive subject line (which may consist of the course number MAT242E followed
by a short phrase summarizing the subject of your e-mail).
2. Start off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.
3. Finally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.

Feel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you. In the past, I have had pretty much tolerance for e-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends. But, now, due to pandemic, I should say that I may not appreciate these e-mails anymore.
Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the semester are not welcomed.


# Academic Honesty Policy

At every stage of the academic life, every ITU student is responsible for obeying the academic honesty policy of ITU stated below:
