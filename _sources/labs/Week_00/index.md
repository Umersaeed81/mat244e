# Week 00

The focus of this course is on mathematical statistics along with some applied statistical topics. 
In this course, I will use Python [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SciPy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html), and [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) libraries to illustrate some theoretical concepts. If you would like to practice yourself with examples which will be given in the class, I strongly suggest you to
study on  the following resources:

- [Introduction to NumPy and Matplotlib by Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html),
- [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html), and
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/).

For each lab material, you can start a live session by pressing the <i class="fas fa-rocket" title="rocket"></i> button at the top-right and selecting a hosted runtime environment such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) or [TheBe](https://thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

You can also build stand-alone web applications based on lab materials (Jupyter Notebooks) involving interactive widgets created with [ipwidgets (interactive HTML widgets)](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To do this requires installing [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) library first. When you launch the relevant Jupyter Notebook on the browser, a Voila button will appear in the toolbar. Then, click-on Voila button to turn the notebook into a seperate web application.  Live examples are available in [here](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila). You can go further and deploy your Voila applications on [HEROKU](https://www.heroku.com/).
