# Week 00

The focus of this course is on mathematical statistics along with some applied statistical topics. 
In this course, I will use Python [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), and [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) libraries to illustrate some theoretical concepts. If you would like to practice yourself with examples which will be given in the class, I strongly suggest you to
study on  the following resources:

- [Introduction to NumPy and Matplotlib by Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2020/numpy-intro.html),
- [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html), and
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/).
